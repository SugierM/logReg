# LogReg project
This project is an attempt to make logistic regression models with as little code as possible

### For now there are 3 working (at some capacity) directories
- `/loadDF` – loads CSV files (currently only CSV format supported)
- `/edit` – provides simple editing for existing DataFrames
- `/clear` – removes all files from the temp folder (clears the working directory)


# With edit from 05.05.2025
There is currently no implemented method to clear the images folder, as the report functionality is not fully developed yet. (But images will overwrite themselves automatically).
